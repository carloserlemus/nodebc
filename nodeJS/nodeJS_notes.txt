Node.JS Notes:

/Response Handling

The response object
    ->responses come in different formats.
        EX. JSON, HTML content... and more!
JSON (response.json)
    If we use response.json we can pass an object as a parameter.
    the .json method will transform it into a JSON.
    In addition it will add content-type application/json header. (?)

SEND FILE (response.sendFile)
    We can send any file. However, browsers can read specific file types.

    the tools we need to use .sendFile:
        path module, _dirname (a variable), and the filename.
        path.join, 

        path.join brings together _dirname and the filename.
        where _dirname is the current directory and filename.
