Node.JS Notes:

/Response Handling

The response object
    ->responses come in different formats.
        EX. JSON, HTML content... and more!
JSON (response.json)
    If we use response.json we can pass an object as a parameter.
    the .json method will transform it into a JSON.
    In addition it will add content-type application/json header. (?)

SEND FILE (response.sendFile)
    We can send any file. However, browsers can read specific file types.

    the tools we need to use .sendFile:
        path module, _dirname (a variable), and the filename.
        path.join, 

        path.join brings together _dirname and the filename.
        where _dirname is the current directory and filename.

EXPRESS ROUTER (MODULE)
    This helps configure the routing in a more organized manner.
    By grouping them with regard to action or resource type

    It's similar to the way you can point an html file to the .js and .css files.

    express has a method called router which essnetially replaces the app = express()
